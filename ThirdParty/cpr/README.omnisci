C++ Requests v1.2.0: https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr/releases/tag/1.2.0

The following changes have been made:

- disabled all status messages from CMake
- CURLE_SSL_CACERT previously was different from
  CURLE_PEER_FAILED_VERIFICATION. curl v1.62.0 defined these as the same, so
  only treat as separate if they are different. See
  https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2901
